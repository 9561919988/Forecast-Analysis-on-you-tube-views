YouTube Views 7-Day Forecast Analysis
This project provides a 7-day forecast analysis for YouTube views using two predictive methods:

Formula-based Forecast
Excel Forecast Sheet
The analysis compares actual views obtained over a 7-day period with forecasted values. Additionally, it calculates upper and lower confidence bounds, which define the range within which the actual views are expected to lie.

Key Components
Views Obtained:

Actual views collected each day over the 7-day period (e.g., 1671 on 15-01-2023 and 2485 on 21-01-2023).
Forecast Methods:

Formula Forecast: Predictive calculations derived from custom formulas.
Forecast Sheet (Excel): Automated predictions generated by Excel's built-in Forecast Sheet tool.
Upper and Lower Confidence Bounds:

Lower Bound: Minimum expected views, ensuring a conservative estimate.
Upper Bound: Maximum expected views, capturing potential peak performance.
Insights
Trends and Accuracy:
While the formula-based forecast remains relatively consistent, Excel's Forecast Sheet offers a higher estimate. This discrepancy highlights varying forecast accuracy depending on the method used.

For instance, on 15-01-2023, the formula forecast is 1750.15, whereas the Excel forecast is 1990.22, with actual views at 1671.
Confidence Intervals:
The confidence bounds effectively capture the variations, providing a range that accounts for uncertainties in view trends.

On 21-01-2023, the lower bound is 1091.01, and the upper bound is 2964.01, reflecting a wider range as views spiked to 2485.
Performance Variations:

Days like 18-01-2023 show actual views (2151) exceeding both forecasts, indicating sudden increases in engagement.
